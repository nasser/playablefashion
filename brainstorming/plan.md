# **Summary**

Often, in creative group exercises, one participant’s voice can dominate the discussion and direction of the group. Some may arrive to the group with an idea already in their head, their heart set on the idea, unable to consider other alternatives. Starting like this can make it hard for others to feel ownership and interest in the project, and can break down the collaborative creative process. The Brainstorming module is a series of exercises, rituals and games, emphasizing collaboration in the ideation process. The goal is to create equal opportunities for each participant to contribute, and for the final ideas to be bigger than anything a single participant could have arrived at on their own.


# **Learning Goals**
- Creating collaborative project that is not based on one person’s idea. 
- Experiencing what it is like to arrive in a place creatively with others that couldn’t be reached alone. 
- Using frameworks for collaborative creative processes and design methods that can be referred to again and again in the future. 
- Learning to work with others and creating a space where everyone can be heard.

**The Exercises & Steps**:

- The Fishbowl: establishing a starting point
- Mindmapping: exploring concepts
- Discussion with “Yes and…”: narrow Down to 3 ideas
- Design Document: Choose one idea 
- Present
#  **Prerequisites**

There are no prerequisites to teach this module. 

# **Context**

**Rituals and Games**
The exercises in the brainstorming module are influenced by rituals and games, in order to create excitement and to emphasize teamwork. For example, when teams send a member to choose a video from the fishbowl, it helps to create the mood like a game show by reminding the participants that they cannot go back once they choose the next video or that this is their final choice. The banter between the students as they figure out whether to take the video or move to the next one is always fun and can potentially bring the team closer. In the mind mapping exercise, it helps to enforce the rules of the exercise strictly.

**Collaboration**
In this module, it is very important for students to get an idea of what a successful collaborative brainstorming process can be like. It is not often taught that with other collaborators, there are ways of getting to certain places and ideas that you would not have gotten to alone. This is an idea that can be carried into workplaces and future projects. Conflict resolution is a crucial collaborative skill, and this exercise equips students to react to ideas that clash with their own.

**Iteration in Design**
Iteration is crucial to the design process. To be able to rapidly explore various ideas and modifications of them at various points of the design process, and the flexibility to improve upon them after coming across problems or receiving feedback, are all design skills that are very valuable.  In this module, iteration and more specifically collaborative iteration is a major theme. 

# **Teaching Approach** 

**Setting the Tone —** **Rules for the Learning Space**
It is important to create a space that does not reject ideas, allows for mutual respect for each other and encourages open discussion. There are a few suggested rules that can be presented at the start of the module in order to set the tone to encourage a more open, creative space. These rules can also be established at the start of the long program, but also can be used for individual modules. While some modules may not require the rules, it is recommended for the Brainstorming module, as students will be discussing extensively with each other. 

It also may help to have the students name, define or identify the content of the rules together as a class. This gives them more ownership of the space, but also may keep concepts more current. The definition of a safe space has changed over the years, has gotten controversial, and even distorted. Perhaps another name for a space where students can speak and discuss openly, varying ideas should be used. 
 

    - Safe Space (?)  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe-space
    - Global Awareness. Being respectful of different identities, cultures, and languages.
    - Social Rules from the Recurse School. These rules are especially useful for learning environments associated with technology.  https://www.recurse.com/manual#sub-sec-social-rules
        - No feigning surprise
        - No well-actually's
        - No back-seat driving
        - No subtle -isms
    - One Mic, One Person. One person speaking at a time. No interruptions.

*These rules are inspired by Global Kid’s rules for their learning spaces.*

# **Setting Up**

**The Space**

    - Cleared Tables and Chairs - clear out chairs during Mindmapping exercise so students can move around the table quickly. 
    - Brightly lit room
    - Set up projector if using slides
# **Tools**
- The FishBowl is website where students can add as many youtube video links as they like, and once refreshed, it will randomly choose a youtube video. It is a digital version of picking something out of a hat or a fishbowl. 
- Non-digital Alternatives
    - Cards for game design http://www.tiltfactor.org/game/grow-a-game/
    - Website that creates random game design prompts http://orteil.dashnet.org/gamegen 
            ***You can click or unclick “sanity setting*”
    - Physical Fishbowl (using USB Flash Drives with preloaded gifs, films or trailers put into a bowl)
- Large newsprint pad/Large post it pad
- Markers or Sharpies 
    - Getting an assortment of colors allows the students to keep track of how they’ve contributed to the exercises. 


# **Lesson Plan**

**Session 1**

**Review Rules for the Learning Space**

**Break into Groups:** For this module, it's important for people to start on equal ground by minimizing prior relationships. This is an opportunity to learn how to collaborate with others, not just friends. With this in mind, put students into randomized groups. One technique is to assign every student a number from one to four and then ask students to get into groups according to the number they were assigned.

**Fishbowl:** [http://thefishbowl.herokuapp.com/](http://thefishbowl.herokuapp.com/) (prototype)
Is a tool to create a starting point for the process of collaboratively developing ideas for games (possibly for other projects). It is a process that encourages participation by everyone when creating the content of the fishbowl, and team participation when deciding upon a youtube video. 
*note: use by more than one class simultaneously would cause problems.* 

1. Individuals go to [http://thefishbowl.herokuapp.com/](http://thefishbowl.herokuapp.com/add)[add](http://thefishbowl.herokuapp.com/add)
2. They find interesting youtube videos
3. They add their URLs to the text box and click "Add Videos" button at bottom when done
4. Repeat steps 1-3 until time runs out
5. Each group chooses a representative
6. Representatives determine their order using rock-paper-scissors
7. Each representative publicly visits [http://thefishbowl.herokuapp.com/](http://thefishbowl.herokuapp.com/)
8. If their group accepts the video, the representative clicks "Remove Video"
9. Otherwise, the representative clicks "Refresh" to get a new video
10. Repeat steps 9-10 until the group agrees on a video, or "Refresh" has been hit two times
11. If  "Refresh" has been hit two times, the group *must* accept the video they are presented
12. The group *may not* return to a previous video they have rejected

*Variation: limiting number of submitted videos per participant or limiting number of refreshes allowed*

**Mindmap**: 

1. Each person picks different marker color
2. Title of video is written at center of paper
3. Thread following example
4. Ensure students can access all sides of paper (rotating paper or get rid of chairs around table if needed)
5. Students take turns adding to the mind map
    1. They can write down a new idea, optionally connecting it to an existing idea
    2. They can connect two existing ideas
6. No talking!
7. No erasing!
8. As many ideas as possible
9. Goal: get groups to exhaust all initial ideas, and push past that point together
10. *Variations: minimum number of ideas per group member (like 100 per person) or filling up page as much as possible*
11. At the end, add more connections between the ideas on the paper if they are missing, and choose "significant" ideas to highlight. Significant ideas may consist of repeated ideas, or ones that have many ideas fanning out of it. 

**Narrow Down:**

- "Yes and..." [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DphjhudlZis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DphjhudlZis) Sometimes I will start with a simple exercise of a collaborative explanation of how someone brushes their teeth using the actual phrase “Yes and…”. Once the concept is understand, then have them discuss their ideas. “Yes and…” allows for building off of previous ideas, exhausting threads of ideas before moving on to another idea. In other words, it allows for students to get to places that they would have not otherwise. 
- By the end of the day narrow down to 3 ideas, that are presented to the entire class/workshop informally.
- Provide time for feedback. 
## **Session 2**

**Pick Idea**:
Get into groups and pick final idea from the three ideas at the end of Session 1 and make a brief design document with the following points: 


- **Summary**: Brief description of game
- **Objective**: The goals of the game's players
- **Ruleset**: List of allowed and disallowed sequences of actions
- **Game Content**: Individual things or objects that makes up the game
- **Storyboards**: Illustrations of key moments or content
    

**Deliverables**: 

    Each group formally presents their ideas for their game with design document content and any supporting materials, like sketches. Q&A follows each presentation. 

**Design Document**

- Have teams fill out a game design document with their idea. This is not limited to text! Encourage teams to draw and sketch and do whatever they need to record their idea.
