# Abstract Electronic Toys Lesson Plan

# Summary
The Abstract Electronic Toys module encourages the student to become more than just a consumer of electronics, but also become more aware of what might be inside the “black box”, and ultimately more critical. Through hacking of the black box, we can take it over, and find alternative uses for it. Students will learn a very basic level of game design, physical games, basic electronics, and prototyping wearable interfaces. 

This module is a stepping stone to the Fashion In Depth module, where the electronics and electric circuitry is explored in more depth. 


# Learning Goals
- Games are more than just video games
- The game design process
- The art of writing rules
- Iteration & Rapid Protyping in Design
- Hacking commercial electronics
- Play testing or User Testing
- Basic circuitry
- What are interfaces

# Prerequisites
While all the information in order to teach this module is included in the content, there is nothing that the teacher needs to know beforehand. It would help however, to know basic electric circuitry and some game design. 

# Context
## Design Concepts in Game Design
Designing games can be a great opportunity to learn about various design methods and concepts. In essence, the game creator is designing a very specific experience they envision the player or user to have. In Playable Fashion the code the creator writes, the circuits they build, the interface they design and the game systems the creator implements, all support a user’s experience. 

### Interfaces & Interactions
Abstract Electronic Toys is essentially a module that explores interfaces and how we interact with them. An interface is hardware and/or software that allows for a user to communicate, control or interact with a computer. For example, a keyboard, mouse and a monitor. A keyboard app on a phone with its touch sensitive screen can act as an interface. A car has a steering wheel, pedals, a stick shift, and a dashboard. With a console game, you have the traditional game controller, the Nintendo Switch or the Wii. In this module, the student starts off with the boxes or doorbell as interfaces, then can create custom interfaces when hacking the hardware. 

This module allows the student to brainstorm and experiment with different kinds of interfaces using various electrically conductive materials. It is a opportunity to emphasize and discuss the gestures and physical movements involved in the interactions, and how even the interfaces can dictate the design of the interactions, and also the other way around, how interactions can dictate the design of the interface. 

### User testing and Play testing
User testing or a more common term in game design, play testing, can help develop a project from a personal vision to something that can be used by others and is also an essential part of the design process. User testing is the process by which users test an idea or prototype, and is often controlled or facilitated by the designer. It is helpful to have questions established beforehand to ask the user when testing and to have clear goals of what to investigate. It is important for designers to take notes and then to consider the feedback given, and whether or not to incorporate changes into the prototype.  Play testing can happen at various points of the process and can test various aspects of the game. In the module, games will be play tested during the design process, as well as when reviewing at the end of the session. 

### Iteration & Rapid prototyping
The repetitive cycle of ideating, prototyping, testing and iterating emerges when designing games. The ability to develop and evolve ideas quickly, are essential skills. 

We have students in this module to list out a certain number of game ideas as they move through the design process, in order to encourage documentation of the threads of ideas. This may seem too structured for a creative process, but ultimately, we want the students to get to a point where through disciplined and repetitive exercise, they are able to identify and hone these design skills.  

### Writing Rules and Objectives for Gameplay
In games, rules are objectives are the basic constraints that define the game experience. There is a skill and art to writing rulesets, and while writing detailed rulesets may seem nit picky or over kill, **it is in the best interest of the game designer to have the players play the game in the intended way.**  Some tips for writing rules: 

1. Define rules and objective(s) as clearly and concisely as possible. 
2. Define roles and objects clearly, especially when they are specific to the game. *For example, a Loot Box will give the player gifts that will aid the player throughout the game.* 
3. Use “player” instead of “you”. *For example, the player must roll the die.* 

## Electronics: Making & Breaking Circuits

In elementary school it is a common science exercise to teach the basics of electrical circuitry using a battery and a light bulb. It is taught that if you break the circuit the light turns off as there is no electrical flow, and when a circuit is made, there is electrical flow, and therefore, the light turns on. This is the fundamental idea behind the light switch we use everyday. 

This is also the fundamental idea around most of the electronic interfaces we use. Keyboards, mice, traditional game controllers, elevator buttons, the home button on a phone or tablet — all these devices around us use the breaking and making of circuits to “read” or “sense” the physical commands we are sending, whether it is the pushing of a button or the flicking of a switch. 


## Hacking Electronics: Why It Is Important
While opening consumer electronics can have its negative effects, such as voided warranty, breaking or bricking a device, and even affecting your health, it’s nonetheless a fantastic way to learn about the technology around us. If done in a safe, careful manner, hacking electronics can help demystify the “black box” and can allow us to be informed of how technology exists, its use in our lives and more importantly allows us to be critical of it, praise it, and maybe even think of a better iteration or use for it.

### Transforming from Consumer to Producer
Corporations sell products with clear intended use through marketing and through instructions — in essence they dictate the way we use their products. And as consumers, we blindly accept the “black box” the product comes in, and are conditioned to never question or be curious about what lies beyond — this applies to both software and hardware. To recognize this reality, and then to demystify the black box are essential steps in the transformation from being just a consumer to also a producer. 

### Consumer Electronics & Right to Repair
There is a growing trend in consumer electronics that make it harder for us to upgrade, fix or mod the electronics we actually own. Corporations monopolize upgrading and fixing their products with strict warranties, proprietary parts, tools and software, until at a certain point, buying the new product and throwing away the old becomes more affordable than getting it fixed. It’s a win-win situation for the corporation and creates more profit for them, but at the expense of our pockets and at the cost of the environment. 

For more information on the Right to Repair we suggest the following websites/articles:

- http://ifixit.org/right Excellent website that not only posts tear-downs and instructions on how to fix gadgets but also, offers information on why it’s important to be able to repair and upgrade our own devices. 
- http://www.fixerscollective.org/ A local NYC community of fixers who meet and fix consumer electronics. 

### Security & Privacy
The more we are aware of what is inside the black boxes around us, we can be knowledgeable, critical and ultimately can be more involved in and have a voice in how technology is being used in our world. Without awareness, our information, security and privacy can easily be used and compromised. There are those who may ignore this issue, because they believe, “I’m not doing anything wrong, I don’t have anything to hide,” but this is often the viewpoint of the majority and the privileged, and one that is naive and uninformed.

As we become increasingly dependent on smart devices that are no longer limited to our phones, digital assistants and what are essentially devices that are the “Internet of Things”, our awareness of what is inside the “black boxes” and what they are capable of are more important than ever.

## Option 1: Using Custom Boxes

*This option requires that the boxes are made before the class or workshop. Those who are not familiar with building circuits or don’t have enough prep time, it is recommended that you use Option 2: the Wireless Doorbell. It helps to be familiar with Arduino and basic circuit building. Making of the boxes can be another activity, perhaps made by more senior or advanced students. We remove the ATMEGA chip off of the Arduino and create a simple circuit using the [Arduino to Breadboard Tutorial](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/ArduinoToBreadboard). This is a relatively cheap way to make multiple circuits, using only one Arduino board.*

# Setting Up

## Setting the Tone: Games are Not Just Video Games
Because video games are so popular, it is often forgotten that video games are only part of the vast world of games, and that games encompass video games, street games, card games, board games, sports, etc. Games whether they are digital or physical, share many characteristics that can be identified and discussed. We find it important to be able to frame games and game design in and outside of the video game context **as early as possible** in the session for a few reasons: 

The “gamer” culture around video games while can fuel enthusiasm and can initially be the primary motivation to come to the session, it can also be intimidating and even harmful to others. People who do not feel part of that conversation or do not identify themselves as “gamers” can easily feel left out. Having everyone understand from the beginning that games are not just video games, and having them start with the same creative blank slate can be more inclusive and helpful in setting the tone for the rest of the lesson. This can be particularly helpful for future collaborative brainstorming and creating. 

Sometimes simple, ubiquitous physical games can be a better learning tool to illustrate game concepts easier than a commercial video game. For example, when we talk about the importance of narratives in games to teach a player how the game works, it’s easier to understand how important narratives are to games like Rock, Paper, Scissors.  The circular nature of the game system is more easily identified and discussed here, compared to a more complex video game. 

Running simple street games like Ninja or Turtle Wushu at the very beginning of the session can act as an ice-breaker and can additionally help students see that games are not just video games, and they too can be analyzed, critiqued and modded.

## Progression - The Surprise!
It’s important to divide the module up into 2 sessions, and that the hacking session remains unknown during the first session. The purpose of this is this to emphasize the choice to open electronics, which we often take for granted. 

- Session 1: Designing physical games using custom boxes or doorbell system
- Session 2: Hacking boxes and making new interfaces with conductive materials and objects

## Space

- An indoor or outdoor large space to run street games like Turtle Wushu or Ninja.
- When working with the boxes or doorbells, enough space to run around, move and use tables and chairs. Tables should not have anything on top of them. 
- Well lit 
- Make sure you do a battery check before running the module
- Make sure you have back up batteries
- Safety when hacking electronics

****
    
- Sample game: 
  - Set the button on a small table. 
  - Set two chairs 5 ft away from the table edge on opposite sides of the table. Be accurate here -- with a tape measurer and masking tape to mark floor. 
  - Player one sits in one chair and player two sits in the other. 
  - A referee, who is chosen before the start of the game, must yell Go! to start the game. 
  - Once the game is started, both players must try to stand up and hit the button. 
  - Whoever hits the button first is the winner. 
  - If there are any questions as to who the winner is, the referee gets final call.

- Questions based on Sample game: 
  - Why is it important for the players to be equidistant from the button? Fairness is often incredibly important in games and creating a game space. Otherwise, the outcomes can be arbitrary and players will find less meaning to playing. 
  - How can this simple game be modded? Perhaps by changing the position and direction of the players chairs. Reverse the chairs so that the players are sitting with their backs facing each other. Put the chairs on the same side of the table, 15 ft away. Does this change the game? Put chair up by table like when you are dining. How does this change the game? 
  - How easy is it to identify who hit the button first? Why do we have a referee making the final calls? Put in a rule that makes it mandatory for the players to keep their hands on top of the button until the referee has looked it. 
  - Split into groups of 2-4 (?)

### Possible Discussion Questions:
- How did you feel opening the electronics? Corporations will insist that their product is made for a specific use. Do you believe that they are limited to the use they tell us it is for? What examples of electronics/products in the past have been hacked and used for other purposes? 
- Did you enjoy designing physical games? There are games like with the switch that allow for more physical interactions with digital games, instead of sitting on a couch and using a traditional game controller. Do you think there will be more digital physical games in the future? 
- Do you think the interface dictates the gesture or the other way around?
