# Lesson Plan
## Session One

Start the class with [this slideshow](files/slideshow-session-1.pdf)

### Teams and Ideas
*If the class is already divided into teams with game ideas, skip this*

- Run a condensed [Brainstorming](../brainstorming/plan.md) 

### Design Document

- Have teams fill out a game design document with their idea using [this template](files/GDD.pdf).


### Simplification

- Guide the class through the process of simplification to help them shave the idea down to something doable. Some questions:
    - What is new about your idea?
    - What can be faked? What can't be faked?
    - Does your idea require a certain number of things? Can this number be reduced?
    - What parts of your idea are "content" (story, art) and what parts are mechanics?
    - Where can you introduce placeholders?
        - Pre-made sound ([freesound.org](http://freesound.org))
        - Pre-made art ([http://kenney.nl/](http://kenney.nl/))
        - Pre-made code ([unity asset store](https://assetstore.unity.com/))
    - What is the minimum subset of your idea you need to make as a prototype?
    

### Revised Design Document

- Fill out another Game Design Document with the simplified design
    

### Punchlist

- Break down the game design document into each individual task that needs to be finished, and who needs to finish them
    - No matter how minor
    - As specific as possible
- Sort them by dependency, which tasks depend on other tasks?
- Organize them by “department”
    - Art, Code, Writing, Sound, Electronics
- This list shouldn't grow
- Provide time estimations for each task
    - Think worst case
- Cut things if there's no time
    - Knowing what to cut depends on your simplification process
- Put Initials next to tasks the person is responsible for. 
    - Do they seem balanced in terms of effort and time? 
    - Can you help others with some tasks?
    - Where can other people help you? 

## Session Two

Start the class with [this slideshow](files/slideshow-session-2.pdf)

### Production

- Implement tasks, cross things off the list as they finish
- If new ideas come up, keep a log of what to do for the next prototype, but do not add do your punch list!

### Playtest

- Divide class into group A and group B
- Spend 30 mins having group A play tests group B's games, and then reverse the rolls.
- If class is small enough, play each group's game one at a time.
- When a team is having its game tested, it should have questions going in
    - What do you want to know about your game?
    - What moments are you looking for?
    - What problems do you anticipate?
- DO NOT INTERRUPT PEOPLE WHILE THEY ARE PLAYING YOUR GAME
- Gather feedback and start thinking about how to apply this to a future prototype
