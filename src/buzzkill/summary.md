# Buzzkill

The Buzzkill module is an introduction to wearable game controller and preview into the Playable Fashion program, using the Adafruit FLORA and Unity 3D development tools. Most people approach the program not knowing what a wearable game controller is, since there have not been many successful examples in consumer electronics. Participants are asked to make a pair of clapping glove controllers, and through modding a the demo game Buzzkill, we also touch upon game design and programming.

Our goal is to have the student leave the module being excited about this unexplored world of wearable game controllers, a peek into the tools and skills that are needed to make the games, and an understanding of what the entire Playable Fashion program is like.
