1. If you can see the default checkered background, then your image already has a transparent background. If it doesn’t then, make sure you’ve selected the layer with the image you’d like to make transparent. 
2. Choose the magic wand tool on the grid of tools under the miniPaint logo.

3. Click on the background areas to delete. 
4. If it deletes too much or too little, the “power” of the wand can be changed by adjusting the values in the power window on the lower left of the screen.
