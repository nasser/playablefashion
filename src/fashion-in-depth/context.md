## Teaching Approach

There are a few teaching tools and methods that are used that should be noted, designed to enhance and help teachers and students. For example, each participant uses a ink-jet printed piece of cotton stretched over an embroidery hoop, which helps to lead them through each section of the module. It acts like a timeline of the module and a checklist for content learned. Even the stitch marks are spaced in such a way that help students sew even stitches. Worksheets for this module are designed to free up time for the teacher to spend on students having specific problems, by allowing other students to work at their own pace. However, it helps to have teachers show a mini-demonstration before each step of the worksheet. Mini demonstrations are best conducted with a group of students, however many can gather around and visibly see the physical act of creating. This method of having the teacher show a mini-demonstration at various times during a class is a popular teaching technique used in sewing classes and in other craft-based learning scenarios.  

The structure of building with each interface and its respective sample code as a standalone project and then combining them at the end (a.k.a. “frankensteining”) both electrically and by code. The 3 interfaces are as follows: 

- Soft Button (input, creating/breaking a circuit)
- Glove & Conductive Fabric Patch (input, creating/breaking a circuit)
- Neopixels (output, individually addressable RGB Led’s)

Building a project in stages by parts is not only practical as it helps the maker from becoming overwhelmed, but also because it is useful for learning after and outside of the module. It is a common DIY/Maker practice to take from various existing shared code and circuit diagrams, and to “frankenstein” them to be used for whatever prototype the maker imagines. 

Participants can arrive with different levels of experience with crafting, sewing and coding. It is helpful to have some extra tasks set aside for students who are working faster than most in the class, so they do not become bored. For crafting there are ways of customizing various aspects of the components: perhaps by having the student make a custom shaped soft button, or customization of the glove. For sewing, participants can experiment with various stitches, like chainstitching the conductive thread or sewing down the patch, instead of using the adhesive paper. For coding, the code can be customized to do various Neopixel lightning patterns or the hand patch can become a capacitive switch. 

## CS Learning and Other Themes

Participants download Playable Fashion Code for each stand alone interface as it is introduced, and then the teacher reviews it line by line, with special emphasis to the structure: variables, setup and loop. In addition to the semantics, an understanding of the structure can make it easier to then “frankenstein” the code. The difficulty of this approach lies somewhere between downloading code to use without modification (introductory level) and writing code from scratch (more advanced level, see Coding in Depth).

As far as **CS learning** goes, this module is good for learning about state and iteration which are very basic concepts found in all computer languages.  

- State: “is a technical term for all the stored information, at a given instant in time, to which the program has access.” 
- Iteration: “is the act of repeating a process, either to generate an unbounded sequence of outcomes, or with the aim of approaching a desired goal, target or result.”

A variable is an example of state, loop is an example of iteration. 

Another CS concept to point out would be **the tradition or convention to structuring code in a particular way**. There are other ways of structuring code, but there is a certain style/format, in this case the variables, setup and loop, which is used in order to make it easier for others to understand (hardware equivalent is with red and black wires on a circuit representing voltage and ground). These are **“evergreen” concepts** which ultimately help the student learn other programming languages beyond the Arduino language. 

Computational concepts such as **Input and Output (i/o)** can be introduced during this module. See embroidery hoop and code where output and input is indicated. This is the way in which a processing system can communicate with its world around it. 

This module teaches a **multidisciplinary approach,** which is something that is echoed throughout our program.  Teaching the significance and the methods of learning multidisciplinary approaches can not only expose the participant to various potential areas of interests, skills and ultimately careers, but also allows for flexibility against inevitable changes in the technological landscape. 

This module is also a great opportunity to introduce what **open source tools** are and the ideologies behind them in the world of Science and Technology.

### Historical context
In actuality, wearables have been around for a while. Eyeglasses and wrist watches have been utilized for hundreds of years. More recently with the advancement of, miniaturization and drop in costs of technology, we can integrate more complex functions, found in such devices as smart watches and VR headsets.
