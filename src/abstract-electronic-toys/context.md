# Abstract Electronic Toys

## Design Concepts in Game Design
Designing games can be a great opportunity to learn about various design methods and concepts. In essence, the game creator is designing a very specific experience they envision the player or user to have. In Playable Fashion the code the creator writes, the circuits they build, the interface they design and the game systems the creator implements, all support a user’s experience. 

### Interfaces & Interactions
Abstract Electronic Toys is essentially a module that explores interfaces and how we interact with them. An interface is hardware and/or software that allows for a user to communicate, control or interact with a computer. For example, a keyboard, mouse and a monitor. A keyboard app on a phone with its touch sensitive screen can act as an interface. A car has a steering wheel, pedals, a stick shift, and a dashboard. With a console game, you have the traditional game controller, the Nintendo Switch or the Wii. In this module, the student starts off with the boxes or doorbell as interfaces, then can create custom interfaces when hacking the hardware. 

This module allows the student to brainstorm and experiment with different kinds of interfaces using various electrically conductive materials. It is a opportunity to emphasize and discuss the gestures and physical movements involved in the interactions, and how even the interfaces can dictate the design of the interactions, and also the other way around, how interactions can dictate the design of the interface. 

### User testing and Play testing
User testing or a more common term in game design, play testing, can help develop a project from a personal vision to something that can be used by others and is also an essential part of the design process. User testing is the process by which users test an idea or prototype, and is often controlled or facilitated by the designer. It is helpful to have questions established beforehand to ask the user when testing and to have clear goals of what to investigate. It is important for designers to take notes and then to consider the feedback given, and whether or not to incorporate changes into the prototype.  Play testing can happen at various points of the process and can test various aspects of the game. In the module, games will be play tested during the design process, as well as when reviewing at the end of the session. 

### Iteration & Rapid prototyping
The repetitive cycle of ideating, prototyping, testing and iterating emerges when designing games. The ability to develop and evolve ideas quickly, are essential skills. 

We have students in this module to list out a certain number of game ideas as they move through the design process, in order to encourage documentation of the threads of ideas. This may seem too structured for a creative process, but ultimately, we want the students to get to a point where through disciplined and repetitive exercise, they are able to identify and hone these design skills.  

### Writing Rules and Objectives for Gameplay
In games, rules are objectives are the basic constraints that define the game experience. There is a skill and art to writing rulesets, and while writing detailed rulesets may seem nit picky or over kill, **it is in the best interest of the game designer to have the players play the game in the intended way.**  Some tips for writing rules: 

1. Define rules and objective(s) as clearly and concisely as possible. 
2. Define roles and objects clearly, especially when they are specific to the game. *For example, a Loot Box will give the player gifts that will aid the player throughout the game.* 
3. Use “player” instead of “you”. *For example, the player must roll the die.* 

## Electronics: Making & Breaking Circuits

In elementary school it is a common science exercise to teach the basics of electrical circuitry using a battery and a light bulb. It is taught that if you break the circuit the light turns off as there is no electrical flow, and when a circuit is made, there is electrical flow, and therefore, the light turns on. This is the fundamental idea behind the light switch we use everyday. 

This is also the fundamental idea around most of the electronic interfaces we use. Keyboards, mice, traditional game controllers, elevator buttons, the home button on a phone or tablet — all these devices around us use the breaking and making of circuits to “read” or “sense” the physical commands we are sending, whether it is the pushing of a button or the flicking of a switch. 


## Hacking Electronics: Why It Is Important
While opening consumer electronics can have its negative effects, such as voided warranty, breaking or bricking a device, and even affecting your health, it’s nonetheless a fantastic way to learn about the technology around us. If done in a safe, careful manner, hacking electronics can help demystify the “black box” and can allow us to be informed of how technology exists, its use in our lives and more importantly allows us to be critical of it, praise it, and maybe even think of a better iteration or use for it.

### Transforming from Consumer to Producer
Corporations sell products with clear intended use through marketing and through instructions — in essence they dictate the way we use their products. And as consumers, we blindly accept the “black box” the product comes in, and are conditioned to never question or be curious about what lies beyond — this applies to both software and hardware. To recognize this reality, and then to demystify the black box are essential steps in the transformation from being just a consumer to also a producer. 

### Consumer Electronics & Right to Repair
There is a growing trend in consumer electronics that make it harder for us to upgrade, fix or mod the electronics we actually own. Corporations monopolize upgrading and fixing their products with strict warranties, proprietary parts, tools and software, until at a certain point, buying the new product and throwing away the old becomes more affordable than getting it fixed. It’s a win-win situation for the corporation and creates more profit for them, but at the expense of our pockets and at the cost of the environment.

### Security & Privacy
The more we are aware of what is inside the black boxes around us, we can be knowledgeable, critical and ultimately can be more involved in and have a voice in how technology is being used in our world. Without awareness, our information, security and privacy can easily be used and compromised. There are those who may ignore this issue, because they believe, “I’m not doing anything wrong, I don’t have anything to hide,” but this is often the viewpoint of the majority and the privileged, and one that is naive and uninformed.

As we become increasingly dependent on smart devices that are no longer limited to our phones, digital assistants and what are essentially devices that are the “Internet of Things”, our awareness of what is inside the “black boxes” and what they are capable of are more important than ever.
