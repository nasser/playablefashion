# Abstract Electronic Toys

The Abstract Electronic Toys module encourages the student to become more than just a consumer of electronics, but also become more aware of what might be inside the “black box”, and ultimately more critical. Through hacking of the black box, we can take it over, and find alternative uses for it. Students will learn a very basic level of game design, physical games, basic electronics, and prototyping wearable interfaces. 

This module is a stepping stone to the [Fashion In Depth](../fashion-in-depth/plan.md) module, where the electronics and electric circuitry is explored in more depth.
