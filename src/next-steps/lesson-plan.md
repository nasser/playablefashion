# Next Steps

## Learning Objectives
- Be able to keep learning after the workshop.
- Be able to read and use online resources.
- Where to get more components and materials
- Learn to be a part of a community both online (indie game development communities, arduino forums, unity forums) and in RL (playtesting, meetups, festivals, lectures).
- Understand the open source culture/movement and how anyone can be a part.

## Prerequisites
The teacher should have a list of current, up to date links.

## Materials

The Adafruit FLORA budget pack is suitable for this module, because it comes with all the basic components and tools that allow for further exploration on various applications of the FLORA. [https://www.adafruit.com/product/1405](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1405)

## Lesson Plan

### Session One: FLORA
The following are links to information which can help you keep learning after the program is over. 

- [FLORA set up](https://learn.adafruit.com/getting-started-with-flora/overview): So you can set up wherever you want. 
- [FLORA tutorials](https://learn.adafruit.com/getting-started-with-flora/flora-projects): Adafruit makes the FLORA, and so there are many different tutorials for various projects on the website. 
- [Adafruit wearables forum](https://forums.adafruit.com/viewforum.php?f=51): Here, if you get stuck you can ask questions or find similar questions that have been answered. You can also help others when they have issues. 
- [Arduino website](https://www.arduino.cc/): This is the open source hardware technology that the FLORA is based on. 
- [Arduino tutorials](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/HomePage): Even though these tutorials are for the Arduino, they can also be modded to work with the FLORA. For example, on the FLORA the LED pin is 7, while on the Arduino Uno it is 13. Also, great place to learn more about the Adruino Programming language which is the language that is used to program the FLORA. 
- [LessEMF for conductive fabric](https://lessemf.com/fabric.html): A store with a great selection of conductive fabrics. 
- [Adafruit conductive materials](https://www.adafruit.com/search?q=conductive): The Adafruit store with all the conductive materials they sell.


### Session Two: Unity

- Follow the first two videos on [https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/using-the-unity-interface](https://learn.unity.com/tutorial/using-the-unity-interface)
