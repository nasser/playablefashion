# Next Steps

One of the most important long term skills with technology to is to **â€œlearn to learn."** This allows the student to continue growing and acquiring new skills and knowledge about new tools outside of a structured learning environment independently. And so as technology changes they too can adapt to it.

One way to continue learning is by utilizing online tutorials and information that is available online. There are both free tutorials online as well as forums that support communities of people interested in the tools.

Open source hardware and software, like the FLORA and the Arduino IDE, can be particularly useful to learn autonomously, since the software is free, inspectable, and if it is a popular tool, then there is a robust community of people who ask and answer questions on the forums. The student can learn to ask questions on the forums, and eventually give back by answering questions that other people post. The culture around open source tools promote the healthy sharing and exchange of information.

It is also important to know there are many opportunities to show work that is made in the class room, or outside the classroom. And in these spaces, you can receive valuable feedback and support. Not only are there online groups, but also local groups and communities that have their own public spaces for shows and exhibitions, as well as meetups for people interested in meeting other game developers. There are also events, shows, conferences and festivals where work can be shown as well.
