# Game Literacy

## Learning Goals

- Learn how to talk and think like a game designer.
- Start thinking about “what makes a good game.”
- See games as part of culture and start to talk critically about them
- Learn to critique games you enjoy playing
- Set the framework for conversations to come

## Prerequisites
There are no prerequisites to teach this module, however, familiarity with games in general is a plus.

## Lesson Plan
After an introductory session, gameplay sessions involve alternating between playing games and guided discussions about the play experience. The time spent playing and discussing can be adjusted based on the amount of time available to you, though we suggest they be about equal. We’ve played and discussed for 15 minutes in the past. We suggest you play the games before hand to get a feel for them.

Perceptions on what a “real” game is — often violent, military themed, male-centric, so-called “hardcore” games —  can be troublesome and alienating to many. Use this activity as an opportunity to build a broader definition of games and gamers in your students. Make sure to include physical games, casual games, word games, board games, and as much else as you can in all discussions and conversations. Keep an eye out for someone who says they “do not play games” and offer them support. Likewise, keep an eye out for people putting down others’ games and steer the conversation in a more positive direction.

### Introductory Session

- Start the class by having everyone introduce a game that they play and like, and ask them why they like the game.
    - Students might inadvertently reference aspects of this activity in their descriptions, so be alert for that. Being able to point back to something a student said earlier when learning new jargon is a good way to make it approachable.
- Introduce the idea of playing games mindfully, the way a film student watches movies
- Introduce the activity by going over the game literacy vocabulary. In a [slideshow](files/slideshow.pdf), take a minute to define each term, giving examples from games.
    - For each term, ask the students to provide their own examples from games they play.
    - Make sure to explore every term before starting to play.

### Gameplay Session
*For each game you want to play, proceed as follows*

- Gameplay (15 minutes)
    - Some games can be played with the whole class, some will require dividing into groups, and some will be played individually. Divide the class as needed and make sure everyone has access to the game.
    - Before playing, remind the students to play mindfully.
    - Allow students to play for a period of time. If the game includes instructions, allow the students to figure it out for themselves.
    - If students seem confused, allow them to try and figure the game out themselves. Bring up the confusion in the discussion.
    - Five minutes before the end of time, announce to the students that they should wrap up their games
- Discussion (15 minutes)
    - Lead the class in a discussion about the game they just played
    - Focus on deconstructing the game, linking it to the terminology, and comparing it to other games
    - The class may be tempted to discuss superficial aspects of the game, but try and guide them to a deeper conversation
