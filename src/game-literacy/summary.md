# Game Literacy

One for the main goals of Playable Fashion, is to have the participants progress from just being consumers of games to producers of games. One of the most effective ways of doing that is getting students to start thinking and talking like game designers, in other words, expanding their game literacy.  In order to make games effectively, one must *play* games analytically. Just like film or creative writing students learn to watch movies and read literature with a critical nuanced eye, game design students must learn to do the same for their field. This module introduces students to the practices around playing games mindfully and critically in order to analyze, dissect, and learn from them. The experience is broken up into alternating game playing and discussion sections, where the discussion is meant to lead students beyond surface level analyses and towards deeper observations about the medium they want to become a part of.
