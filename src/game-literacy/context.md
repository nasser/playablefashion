# Game Literacy

## Choosing Games
A challenge with this module is that the actual games to play will change over time. While some will be timeless, others will be a product of the historical moment in which you teach the workshop. We will recommend the games we used when teaching Playable Fashion, but bear in mind that they may be dated and less meaningful by the time you use this content.

This module is a good opportunity to demonstrate the wide range of what games can actually be. Depending on the class, there may be some assumptions that a “real game” is only a game played on a computer or console. When selecting games, try and throw unconventional examples into the mix when possible. Physical games, board games, and card games are an excellent complement to video games.

A good game for this activity has the following properties:


1. **Concise** Students can get the gist of the game in a short amount of time. Long-engagement games that require several hours to experience are not a good fit for this activity.
2. **Accessible** Depending on the physical location you are teaching in, resources like the internet or space or time to download and install software may be limited or missing. Avoid games that are too demanding on these limited resources.
3. **Novel** Games that do new things or present interesting twists on old ideas are a great fit. Anything that sparks a conversation is a good idea.

Try and keep up to date with what games are new and popular, as well as experimental work, and less popular titles. Some places to keep an eye on are:


- [https://itch.io/](https://itch.io/) Lots of indie and web-accessible games
- [https://boardgamegeek.com/](https://boardgamegeek.com/) New and classic board games
- [http://www.comeoutandplay.org/](http://www.comeoutandplay.org/) For larger physical games

### Critique
Unlike the games, however, the *approach* to analyzing gameplay is truly timeless, and is the real thing to focus on in this module. Because this is a form of media criticism, there are no hard and fast rules for what is right or wrong. The goal is to expose students to long form analysis of games and gameplay so that they can, over time, develop their own personal sense of taste and be able to articulate it.

### Why does this matter?

### Genres

## Vocabulary

This activity revolves around giving concrete terms to the abstract concepts behind the design of a game. This vocabulary will change from designer to designer, but covers the core ideas. It is a result of the training provided by the games-focused track at the Parsons Masters of Fine Arts in Design and Technology program, specifically as taught by Nicholas Fortugno and documented in [Rules of Play](https://www.amazon.com/Rules-Play-Design-Fundamentals-Press/dp/0262240459/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1497986137&sr=8-1&keywords=rules+of+play) by Katie Salen and Eric Zimmerman.
