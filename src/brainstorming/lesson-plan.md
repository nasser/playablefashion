# Brainstorming

# Learning Goals
- Creating collaborative project that is not based on one person’s idea. 
- Experiencing what it is like to arrive in a place creatively with others that couldn’t be reached alone. 
- Using frameworks for collaborative creative processes and design methods that can be referred to again and again in the future. 
- Learning to work with others and creating a space where everyone can be heard.

## The Exercises & Steps

- The Fishbowl: establishing a starting point
- Mindmapping: exploring concepts
- Discussion with “Yes and…”: narrow Down to 3 ideas
- Design Document: Choose one idea 
- Present

## Prerequisites

There are no prerequisites to teach this module. 

# Setting Up

## The Space

- Cleared Tables and Chairs - clear out chairs during Mindmapping exercise so students can move around the table quickly. 
- Brightly lit room
- Set up projector if using slides

# Tools
- The FishBowl is website where students can add as many youtube video links as they like, and once refreshed, it will randomly choose a youtube video. It is a digital version of picking something out of a hat or a fishbowl. 
- Non-digital Alternatives
    - Cards for game design [http://www.tiltfactor.org/game/grow-a-game/](http://www.tiltfactor.org/game/grow-a-game/)
    - Website that creates random game design prompts [http://orteil.dashnet.org/gamegen](http://orteil.dashnet.org/gamegen)
            *You can click or unclick “sanity setting*”
    - Physical Fishbowl (using USB Flash Drives with preloaded gifs, films or trailers put into a bowl)
- Large newsprint pad/Large post it pad
- Markers or Sharpies 
    - Getting an assortment of colors allows the students to keep track of how they’ve contributed to the exercises. 


# Lesson Plan

## Session 1 

Review Rules for the Learning Space

Break into Groups: For this module, it's important for people to start on equal ground by minimizing prior relationships. This is an opportunity to learn how to collaborate with others, not just friends. With this in mind, put students into randomized groups. One technique is to assign every student a number from one to four and then ask students to get into groups according to the number they were assigned.

Fishbowl: [http://thefishbowl.herokuapp.com/](http://thefishbowl.herokuapp.com/) (prototype)
Is a tool to create a starting point for the process of collaboratively developing ideas for games (possibly for other projects). It is a process that encourages participation by everyone when creating the content of the fishbowl, and team participation when deciding upon a youtube video. 
*note: use by more than one class simultaneously would cause problems.* 

1. Individuals go to [http://thefishbowl.herokuapp.com/](http://thefishbowl.herokuapp.com/add)[add](http://thefishbowl.herokuapp.com/add)
2. They find interesting youtube videos
3. They add their URLs to the text box and click "Add Videos" button at bottom when done
4. Repeat steps 1-3 until time runs out
5. Each group chooses a representative
6. Representatives determine their order using rock-paper-scissors
7. Each representative publicly visits [http://thefishbowl.herokuapp.com/](http://thefishbowl.herokuapp.com/)
8. If their group accepts the video, the representative clicks "Remove Video"
9. Otherwise, the representative clicks "Refresh" to get a new video
10. Repeat steps 9-10 until the group agrees on a video, or "Refresh" has been hit two times
11. If  "Refresh" has been hit two times, the group *must* accept the video they are presented
12. The group *may not* return to a previous video they have rejected

*Variation: limiting number of submitted videos per participant or limiting number of refreshes allowed*

### Mindmap

1. Each person picks different marker color
2. Title of video is written at center of paper
3. Thread following example
4. Ensure students can access all sides of paper (rotating paper or get rid of chairs around table if needed)
5. Students take turns adding to the mind map
    1. They can write down a new idea, optionally connecting it to an existing idea
    2. They can connect two existing ideas
6. No talking!
7. No erasing!
8. As many ideas as possible
9. Goal: get groups to exhaust all initial ideas, and push past that point together
10. *Variations: minimum number of ideas per group member (like 100 per person) or filling up page as much as possible*
11. At the end, add more connections between the ideas on the paper if they are missing, and choose "significant" ideas to highlight. Significant ideas may consist of repeated ideas, or ones that have many ideas fanning out of it. 

### Narrow Down

- "Yes and..." [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DphjhudlZis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DphjhudlZis) Sometimes I will start with a simple exercise of a collaborative explanation of how someone brushes their teeth using the actual phrase “Yes and…”. Once the concept is understand, then have them discuss their ideas. “Yes and…” allows for building off of previous ideas, exhausting threads of ideas before moving on to another idea. In other words, it allows for students to get to places that they would have not otherwise. 
- By the end of the day narrow down to 3 ideas, that are presented to the entire class/workshop informally.
- Provide time for feedback. 

## Session 2

### Pick Idea
Get into groups and pick final idea from the three ideas at the end of Session 1 and make a brief design document with the following points: 


- **Summary**: Brief description of game
- **Objective**: The goals of the game's players
- **Ruleset**: List of allowed and disallowed sequences of actions
- **Game Content**: Individual things or objects that makes up the game
- **Storyboards**: Illustrations of key moments or content
    

**Deliverables**:
Each group formally presents their ideas for their game with design document content and any supporting materials, like sketches. Q&A follows each presentation. 

**Design Document**

- Have teams fill out a game design document with their idea. This is not limited to text! Encourage teams to draw and sketch and do whatever they need to record their idea.
