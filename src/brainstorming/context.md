# Brainstorming

## Rituals and Games
The exercises in the brainstorming module are influenced by rituals and games, in order to create excitement and to emphasize teamwork. For example, when teams send a member to choose a video from the fishbowl, it helps to create the mood like a game show by reminding the participants that they cannot go back once they choose the next video or that this is their final choice. The banter between the students as they figure out whether to take the video or move to the next one is always fun and can potentially bring the team closer. In the mind mapping exercise, it helps to enforce the rules of the exercise strictly.

## Collaboration
In this module, it is very important for students to get an idea of what a successful collaborative brainstorming process can be like. It is not often taught that with other collaborators, there are ways of getting to certain places and ideas that you would not have gotten to alone. This is an idea that can be carried into workplaces and future projects. Conflict resolution is a crucial collaborative skill, and this exercise equips students to react to ideas that clash with their own.

## Iteration in Design
Iteration is crucial to the design process. To be able to rapidly explore various ideas and modifications of them at various points of the design process, and the flexibility to improve upon them after coming across problems or receiving feedback, are all design skills that are very valuable.  In this module, iteration and more specifically collaborative iteration is a major theme. 

# Teaching Approach

## Setting the Tone — Rules for the Learning Space
It is important to create a space that does not reject ideas, allows for mutual respect for each other and encourages open discussion. There are a few suggested rules that can be presented at the start of the module in order to set the tone to encourage a more open, creative space. These rules can also be established at the start of the long program, but also can be used for individual modules. While some modules may not require the rules, it is recommended for the Brainstorming module, as students will be discussing extensively with each other. 

It also may help to have the students name, define or identify the content of the rules together as a class. This gives them more ownership of the space, but also may keep concepts more current. The definition of a safe space has changed over the years, has gotten controversial, and even distorted. Perhaps another name for a space where students can speak and discuss openly, varying ideas should be used. 
 

- Safe Space (?)  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe-space](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe-space)
- Global Awareness. Being respectful of different identities, cultures, and languages.
- Social Rules from the Recurse School. These rules are especially useful for learning environments associated with technology.  [https://www.recurse.com/manual#sub-sec-social-rules](https://www.recurse.com/manual#sub-sec-social-rules)
    - No feigning surprise
    - No well-actually's
    - No back-seat driving
    - No subtle -isms
- One Mic, One Person. One person speaking at a time. No interruptions.

*These rules are inspired by Global Kid’s rules for their learning spaces.*
