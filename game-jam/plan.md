# Learning Goals
- How to get a game finished
    - How to work quickly
    - How to avoid getting stuck in your own head/analysis paralysis
- Techniques
    - Iteration
    - Play testing
    - Planning
    - Time management
    - How to work with others
- What the full production process is like

**Note** Although we are being specific with our process for this module, ideally we want the students to walk away knowing that there are many such structures out there that can help them complete their projects, and they will find the ones that work for them as they grow as game developers.

# Context
## Community

Game Jams are a great way to meet people, play new games, and get your own games shown. They’re low-stakes, experimental, and a big part of the independent game design community. By preparing for such an event with the support of a class, students can take their first steps towards joining the larger game design industry.

# Tools
- Game Development Tools (e.g. Unity)
- Internet without access controls
- Collaboration Tools
    - Trello
    - Slack
    - DropBox
    - Git/Github
# Materials
- Paper and pencil
# Lesson Plan
## Session One

**Teams and Ideas**
*If the class is already divided into teams with game ideas, skip this*

- Run a condensed [+Brainstorming Lesson Plan](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Brainstorming-Lesson-Plan-qIDW8VT23fJbbLzBCw3tg) 

**Design Document**

- Have teams fill out a game design document with their idea

**Simplification**

- Guide the class through the process of simplification to help them shave the idea down to something doable. Some questions:
    - What is new about your idea?
    - What can be faked? What can't be faked?
    - Does your idea require a certain number of things? Can this number be reduced?
    - What parts of your idea are "content" (story, art) and what parts are mechanics?
    - Where can you introduce placeholders?
        - Pre-made sound (freesound.org)
        - Pre-made art ([http://kenney.nl/](http://kenney.nl/))
        - Pre-made code (unity asset store)
    - What is the minimum subset of your idea you need to make as a prototype?
    

**Revised Design Document**

- Fill out another Game Design Document with the simplified design
    

**Punchlist**

- Break down the game design document into each individual task that needs to be finished, and who needs to finish them
    - No matter how minor
    - As specific as possible
- Sort them by dependency, which tasks depend on other tasks?
- Organize them by “department”
    - Art, Code, Writing, Sound, Electronics
- This list shouldn't grow
- Provide time estimations for each task
    - Think worst case
- Cut things if there's no time
    - Knowing what to cut depends on your simplification process
- Put Initials next to tasks the person is responsible for. 
    - Do they seem balanced in terms of effort and time? 
    - Can you help others with some tasks?
    - Where can other people help you? 
## Session Two

**Production**

- Implement tasks, cross things off the list as they finish
- If new ideas come up, keep a log of what to do for the next prototype, but do not add do your punch list!

**Playtest**

- Divide class into group A and group B
- Spend 30 mins having group A play tests group B's games, and then reverse the rolls.
- If class is small enough, play each group's game one at a time.
- When a team is having its game tested, it should have questions going in
    - What do you want to know about your game?
    - What moments are you looking for?
    - What problems do you anticipate?
- DO NOT INTERRUPT PEOPLE WHILE THEY ARE PLAYING YOUR GAME
- Gather feedback and start thinking about how to apply this to a future prototype
