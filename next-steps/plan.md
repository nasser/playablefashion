# Next Steps Lesson Plan

## Summary

Next Steps is designed to help students continue learning after the workshop is over, on their own time and pace. It works best when run towards the end. In this module, we point them in the right direction by introducing the tutorials, material sources, and online/live communities that exist around the tools they have been using.

Next steps can be modified to be used for other tools besides the FLORA and Untiy. When a tool is popular, there are usually places where an online community forms, and where there are projects and experiences shared. When it comes to local game development communities, there are always more and more collectives and groups forming, even in unexpected areas. So it’s worth looking it up wherever you may be. 

## Learning Objectives
- Be able to keep learning after the workshop.
- Be able to read and use online resources.
- Where to get more components and materials
- Learn to be a part of a community both online (indie game development communities, arduino forums, unity forums) and in RL (playtesting, meetups, festivals, lectures).
- Understand the open source culture/movement and how anyone can be a part.


## Prerequisites

The teacher should have a list of current, up to date links. 

## Context

One of the most important long term skills with technology to is to **“learn to learn."** This allows the student to continue growing and acquiring new skills and knowledge about new tools outside of a structured learning environment independently. And so as technology changes they too can adapt to it.

One way to continue learning is by utilizing online tutorials and information that is available online. There are both free tutorials online as well as forums that support communities of people interested in the tools.

Open source hardware and software, like the FLORA and the Arduino IDE, can be particularly useful to learn autonomously, since the software is free, inspectable, and if it is a popular tool, then there is a robust community of people who ask and answer questions on the forums. The student can learn to ask questions on the forums, and eventually give back by answering questions that other people post. The culture around open source tools promote the healthy sharing and exchange of information.

It is also important to know there are many opportunities to show work that is made in the class room, or outside the classroom. And in these spaces, you can receive valuable feedback and support. Not only are there online groups, but also local groups and communities that have their own public spaces for shows and exhibitions, as well as meetups for people interested in meeting other game developers. There are also events, shows, conferences and festivals where work can be shown as well.

## Lesson Plan

### Session One: FLORA
The following are links to information which can help you keep learning after the program is over. 

**FLORA set up:** https://learn.adafruit.com/getting-started-with-flora/overview
So you can set up wherever you want. 

**FLORA tutorials:** https://learn.adafruit.com/getting-started-with-flora/flora-projects
Adafruit makes the FLORA, and so there are many different tutorials for various projects on the website. 

**Adafruit wearables forum:**  https://forums.adafruit.com/viewforum.php?f=51
Here, if you get stuck you can ask questions or find similar questions that have been answered. You can also help others when they have issues. 

**Arduino website:** https://www.arduino.cc/
This is the open source hardware technology that the FLORA is based on. 

**Arduino tutorials:** https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/HomePage
Even though these tutorials are for the Arduino, they can also be modded to work with the FLORA. For example, on the FLORA the LED pin is 7, while on the Arduino Uno it is 13. Also, great place to learn more about the Adruino Programming language which is the language that is used to program the FLORA. 

**LessEMF for conductive fabric:** https://lessemf.com/fabric.html
A store with a great selection of conductive fabrics. 

**Adafruit conductive materials including conductive thread:** https://www.adafruit.com/search?q=conductive The Adafruit store with all the conductive materials they sell.


### Session Two: Unity

- Follow the first two videos on http://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/modules/beginner/live-training-archive/editor-basics
